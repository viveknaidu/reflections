How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    --Spot the actual code which is causing the o/p to show up differently.

    How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
    efficient programmer in the long term?

        --We can get back to previous versiond and make necessary changes instead of writing it all the way again.

	What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
	commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
	docs does?

	  --you make real logical changes 

	    Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
	    files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	        -I think it is time saving and to support the staging work flow

		How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

		    --git log pops up the complete data about files
		    --git diff pops up one line info about files and also speaks more about the  changes

		    How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
		    could break something?

		        --bcz we got a backup in place

			Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

			    --creating versions of files.
